## DA2 Term Project 
### Abstract 
The research is aimed to answer the question of whether and how performance metrics are affecting the salary of NBA players? The result is based on a data set of NBA salaries 1985 - 2018 and averages of player statistics (efficiency, number of games played, etc.). The main assumption is that the salaries and the performance stats are positively correlated. This analysis can be useful for general managers who are looking to extend contracts with existing players or sing new players. It suppose to provide an insight to what salary is to be expected for a player with certain characteristics and explore which players are over-valued and which players are under-valued.
